**Describe the bug**

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

I provided `hype` with the following input:

```html
<h1>Title</h1>
```


The following output was generated:

```markdown
# Title
```

The expected output should instead have been:

```markdown
# Title!!!
```

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here. For example, if you changed the default options or used a plugin. Also adding the version from the `go.mod` is helpful.
